## Features

- Voice-based user interface for user queries
- Speech-to-text functionality for converting voice input to text
- Integration with GPT for processing user queries
- Text-to-speech functionality for converting GPT responses to audio
- Deployed on [Hosting Platform Name](insert link to the deployed site)
